##Introduction

This is a *parody* gaming website where you can play games?!

##Code

Mostly used javascript to code the games.

Used some bootstrap and css to style the website and make it responsive.

##About

This website has 4 pages: Home, Menu, About and Contact.

Navbar, jumbotron, cards, font-awesome are some of the bootstrap elements used.

You can directly link bootstrap using bootstrap cdn instead of installing the dependencies. That is what I did here.
